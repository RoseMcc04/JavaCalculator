# JavaCalculator by: Rose McCormack

Hello, my name is Rose McCormack and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with minors in Computer Information Systems and Statistics at Appalachian State University. I wanted to create this medium-sized calculator as a way to demonstrate my skills in Java and concepts in the object-oriented programming paradigm. 

## Concepts Covered

The current concepts covered in this project include inheritance, polymorphism, generics, interfaces, graphical user interfaces, and Java documentation. 

## Uses

I hope to use this calculator project as a teaching tool for introductory and intermediate concepts in the Java programming language. I wanted to learn how to apply content I learned in my introductory courses into a project for the world to see. 

## Clone Instructions

1. Clone the repository into your file system. Files will be created automatically for you.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RoseMcc04/JavaCalculator.git
```

2. Create a new branch for your contributions. I will create pull requests and take time to review them. Make sure you are on main.
```bash
git checkout main
git branch <user-name> 
```

3. Add a file to this branch of the repository. I would prefer if you kept it as a text file or markdown file.
```bash
nano <user-name>.<txt, md>
```

4. Commit your changes in git. 
```bash
git commit -m "I made a commit."
```

5. Push changes to your individualized branch. 
```bash
git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>
```

## Activation Instructions

1. After the repository is cloned, you will type in the following script from the directory you cloned the repository in.
```bash
cd Driver
```
2. Run the Java compiler to make sure that there are no errors before activating the program.
```bash
javac Driver.java
```

3. When the code compiles correctly, you can run the code by inputting the following command.
```bash
java Driver
```
