# JavaCalculator by: Rose McCormack

Hello, my name is Rose McCormack and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with minors in Computer Information Systems and Statistics at Appalachian State University. I wanted to create this medium-sized calculator as a way to demonstrate my skills in Java and concepts in the object-oriented programming paradigm. 

## Concepts Covered

The current concepts covered in this project include inheritance, polymorphism, generics, interfaces, graphical user interfaces, and Java documentation. 

## Uses

I hope to use this calculator project as a teaching tool for introductory and intermediate concepts in the Java programming language. I wanted to learn how to apply content I learned in my introductory courses into a project for the world to see.
