# JavaCalculator Purpose

Besides the text in the about section, I wanted to start out with making a project by using the Object-Oriented Paradigm along with my interest in making educational software solutions. The concepts I hope to finally master include Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Documentation, Exceptions, and also possibly J-Unit testing.
